Godot Scramble
==============
Scramble written for Godot 3.1

Godot Scramble is an accurate remake of the classic arcade game from 1981. Written in GD script for the Godot game engine. For this game I implemented my own state machine to make the many phases of the game easier to manage. I also poured over the original [assembly language](https://seanriddle.com/scramble.asm) code to understand how the game actually worked and extracted the landscape/maze layouts.



**Features**

* Pixel perfect sprites (and maze layouts) from the original game
* Includes all 6 levels
* Achievements system
* Attract mode
* Top 10 high score save system

## Screenshots

### Gameplay
During the attract mode I made my game actually look like it was playing itself.

### Highscores
Just like in the original game it tracks the top scores

### Achievements
Not in the original arcade game but I've added Xbox style achievements which you can unlock as you improve
