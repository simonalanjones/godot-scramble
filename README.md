Godot Scramble
==============
Scramble written for Godot 3.1

Godot Scramble is an accurate remake of the classic arcade game from 1981. Written in GD script for the Godot game engine. For this game I implemented a state machine to make the many phases of the game easier to manage.

**Features**

* Pixel perfect sprites from the original game using
* Achievements system in the style of Xbox/Steam
* Attract mode
* Top 10 high score save system

## Screenshots

### Gameplay
During the attract mode I made my game actually look like it was playing itself.
